### SOL Distribution Program

This is a Solana Smart Contract I wrote to practice anchor development and learn the best practices to write solana smart contracts.

This contract is just for learning purposes and is not intended to be used on mainnet.

Key components:
- A treasury account holding the SOL Token
- PDA Signer to execute the txn for distribution
- Parameters amount, address for the token from tresury to be distributed
